              Hello, all gamers! My name is pose8don, I am a student and I have
              created this exciting game for you. I would like to offer you an
              opportunity to support the development of the game and help make
              it even better. Your support will enable me to continue developing
              the game and providing it for free, without ads.
            </p>
            <p class="text-support">
              My game is based on a simple yet captivating word-guessing
              concept. The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word
              with the fewest attempts and in the shortest time possible. I
              strive to make the game more interesting and diverse by adding new
              features and enhancements.
            </p>

              contributions will enable me to work on the game, add new levels,
              features, and ensure the best gaming experience for you.
