Welcome to my exciting word-guessing game! Get ready to put your vocabulary
skills to the test and have a great time challenging yourself. Here's how the
game works:

Once you start the game, the website will randomly generate a word for you to
guess. Your mission is to figure out the secret word as quickly as possible and
with the fewest attempts.

Simply enter your guesses into the provided form, and the website will provide
you with feedback on how close your guess is to the actual word. It could
indicate the number of correct letters or provide a similarity score to guide
you in the right direction.

Your goal is to use the feedback from each guess to refine your next attempt and
inch closer to the correct answer. The faster you guess the word and the fewer
attempts you need, the higher you'll climb on the leaderboard.

Feel free to challenge yourself with different difficulty levels or explore
various word categories. This game is all about improving your skills, beating
your own records, and competing against other players for the top spot.

As you play, the website will keep track of your progress, recording your time
taken and the number of attempts made. You can always check your previous
results and strive for better scores.

So, dive into the word-guessing adventure and show off your linguistic prowess.
Whether you're a wordsmith or looking to expand your vocabulary, this game
offers fun and excitement for everyone. Let the guessing begin!
